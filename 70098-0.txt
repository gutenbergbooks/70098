The Old Burying-Ground.

  “The Pilgrim Fathers are at rest:
    When Summer’s throned on high,
  And the world’s warm breast is in verdure dressed,
    Go, stand on the hill where they lie.
  The earliest ray of the golden day
    On that hallowed spot is cast,
  And the evening sun, as he leaves the world,
    Looks kindly on that spot last.”

  —PIERPONT.


No spot in Plymouth is so interesting to the antiquary as Burial
Hill. Here are the sites of the Pilgrims’ fort and watch-tower. Here
sleep the early settlers of the colony, the heroes of the Revolution
and of our later wars, and the men who went “down to the sea in
ships” and braved dangers, in the days of Plymouth’s maritime glory.
Here are to be seen the rude symbols of the sculptor’s art and the
crude effusions of the elegiac poet.

Burial Hill is 165 feet above the sea level, and rises abruptly just
back of the town’s busiest thoroughfare. It is irregular in form and
contains about eight acres. From this elevation the visitor has a
splendid panorama of ocean and country. Nestling at his feet, between
the hill and the sea, are the thickly clustering roofs of the old
town. Turning his eyes northward, he sees in the far distance the
villages of Kingston and Duxbury and the monument on Captain’s Hill,
erected in memory of Myles Standish, the doughty Pilgrim commander.
To the west stretches a rolling swell of hills, ending in an almost
unbroken forest, through whose shades Massasoit led his warriors to
meet the Plymouth colonists. On the south, shrouded in purple mist,
are the “Pine Hills” of Manomet. Looking eastward, across the bay he
spies the green dot known as Clark’s Island, where the Pilgrims spent
their first Sabbath; and far beyond the shining strand of Plymouth
Beach, if the day be clear and his vision keen, he can just discern
Provincetown, at the point of Cape Cod,—the “tip end of Yankee-land.”

[Illustration: Clark’s Island.]

Visited as it is daily by tourists from all parts of the world, it
is fitting that this consecrated ground should be well cared for and
that its surroundings should be somewhat in keeping with its historic
character. By the will of J. Henry Stickney of Baltimore, late
vice-president of the Pilgrim Society, $10,000 was bequeathed for
improvements on this ground. It had been suggested that the legacy
be used in removing some, at least, of the unsightly buildings which
skirt the foot of the hill on the easterly side, and in the erection
of an ornamental gateway at the Town Square entrance.

[Illustration: Church of the First Parish.]

There are several ways of approaching Burial Hill, but the main
entrance is at Town Square. As we pass through the gateway the new
First Church, now in process of building (1896), looms up on our
left. It is of gray stone, in the Norman type of architecture,
and its severity of style is suggestive of the rugged lives of
the Fathers. In the vestibule of the square central tower will be
placed tablets of a historical character. This church is the oldest
religious organization in the country. In an unbroken succession the
ministry of this church has continued from the days of Robinson and
Brewster to the present. Its records are piously preserved.

[Illustration: The Old Fort and First Meeting-house.]

Aside from its interest to those who find pleasure in meditation
among the tombs of past generations, Burial Hill has a history which
forms a part of the early history of the town. Long before the spot
was used for burial purposes, it served as a ground for possible
defence against the savage foe, and here the first church of the
colony was established. Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims,
on Dec. 21, 1620, they set about to provide against attack from the
redskins, and we learn from their records that “in one field is
a great hill, on which we poynt to make a platform and plant our
ordnance, which will command all round about.”

In 1622 a larger fort was erected, and in 1627 De Raisieres describes
it as a large square house, with flat roof made of thick sawn planks,
stayed with oak beams, upon the top of which six cannon were mounted.
The lower part was used for a church. The Pilgrims assembled at beat
of drum, each with his musket or firelock, and marched to the place
of worship.

The exact situation of this fort is unknown. No traces of it remain.
It is reasonable to suppose, however, that it stood well toward the
top of the hill on the southeasterly side, on a spot which would
command the approach from Leyden Street (the first thoroughfare) on
the east and the approach from the path leading to the fording-place
on the south. This path, now Spring Street, leads directly from the
hill to Town Brook.

On Sept. 23, 1643, it was agreed that a watchhouse “shall be
forthwith built of brick.” This structure stood at the top of the
hill, on the southeasterly side, and commanded a wide view of all
the country about. Its bounds are marked by four square granite
blocks, and a small oval stone on a standard, suitably inscribed,
more definitely designates the location. Within recent years pieces
of the brick of which this watchhouse, or watch-tower, as it is more
commonly called, have been unearthed.

Strolling down the southeasterly slope, the visitor comes to another
similar oval stone, which tells us that here stood the old fort,
erected in 1621. This may be the site of the first fortification,
but history makes no record of it. We have evidence, however, that
in 1676, when invasion from King Philip, the Indian chieftain, was
feared, a fort was built on this spot, and the conformation of the
ground indicates the existence at some time of such a work. On Feb.
19, 1676, the colonists decided to erect a fortification, “to be
a hundred foot square, the pallasadoes to be ten foot and a halfe
longe; to be sett two foot and a halfe in the Ground; and to be
sett against a post and a Rail ... and that there shal be a watch
house erected within the said ffence or fortification, and that the
three peece of ordnance shal be planted within the said ffence or
fortification ... said watch house which is to be sixteen foot in
length and twelve foot in breadth and eight foot stud, to be walled
with board.”

This construction is significant of the peril of the times and of
the stern and unbending determination of the Forefathers. With the
close of King Philip’s War the fort was abandoned, and in 1677 the
material of which it was built was granted to one William Harlow.
Some of the massive timbers were used in the construction of the old
Harlow house on Sandwich Street, and are still to be seen.

[Illustration: William Harlow House, 1677.

Built of timber from old Burial Hill Fort.]


The hill was not used as a place of burial until after it was
abandoned for defensive purposes. Those of the “Mayflower” company
who died the first winter were buried on Cole’s Hill, and, while no
traces of their graves remain, a tablet appropriately inscribed marks
their resting-place. Others of the Pilgrim band found burial on their
own estates, and no man knoweth their sepulchre. The first mention
of Burial Hill as a cemetery was in 1698, when Chief Justice Sewall
recorded the following in his diary: “I walk out in the morn to see
the mill, then turn up to the graves, come down to the meeting-house,
and seeing the door partly open went in and found a very convenient
place to pray.”

[Illustration: General View.]

The oldest stone in this ground is that of Edward Gray, and bears
the date of 1681. It is probable, however, that earlier burials took
place here. Tradition says that the oldest grave is that of John
Howland, who died in 1672, although the stone which marks it was
erected within comparatively recent years. Tradition also places here
the earthly remains of Gov. William Bradford, and a monument bearing
his name rises among the graves of the Bradford family, the exact
place of the Governor’s interment, however, not being designated.

There are six ancient gravestones bearing date before 1700, as
follows:—

  Edward Gray, 1681.
  William Crowe, 1683-84.
  Hannah Clark, 1687.
  Thomas Cushman, 1691.
  Thomas Clark, 1697.
  Ten children of John and Josiah Cotton, 1699.

Possibly there is a seventh,—the defaced tombstone of Nathaniel
Thomas, who is said to have died in 1697. The figures on the stone
are illegible.

All these stones are on the summit of the hill, within a narrow
radius, and near the intersection of the two main paths. With the
exception of Gray’s, all are of English make, and in fact most of
those bearing dates to 1745 were brought from across the water.

[Illustration: William Crowe tombstone]

The Gray stone, the oldest on the hill, as has been said, is of dark,
compact slate. It probably has the usual “cherub,” or symbol; if
so, it is concealed by the iron hood which protects the edges from
water and frost. By its side is a wooden slab bearing the legend,
“The Grave of Edward Gray, June, 1681.” The inscription on the stone
is as follows:—

  Here Lyeth ye Body
  of E D W A R D  G R A Y
  Gent Aged About
  52 years & Departd
  this life ye Last of
  June 1681

Edward Gray appeared in Plymouth about the year 1643. Tradition has
it that he and his brother were sent from England in order that
scheming relations might obtain possession of their property. He
became a merchant, and the wealthiest man in the colony.

The stone of William Crowe, the next in order of date, is of purple
slate and is thus inscribed:—

  Here lies buried
  ye body of Mr
  W I L L I A M  C R O W E
  Aged About 55 years
  who decd January
  1683-4

The Bradford obelisk is one of the first objects to claim the
visitor’s attention. It is of white marble on a granite base, and
rises to a height of eight feet or more. On the south side are these
words:—

  H I William Bradford of Austerfield Yorkshire England. Was the son
  of William and Alice Bradford He was Governor of Plymouth Colony
  from 1621 to 1633 1635 1637 1639 to 1643 1645 to 1657

On the north side is a Hebrew sentence, said to signify “Jehovah is
our help,” but by other Hebrew scholars translated “In Jehovah’s
name I die.” Then follows:—

[Illustration: Gov. Bradford’s Monument.]

  Under this stone rest the ashes of William Bradford a zealous
  Puritan & sincere Christian Gov. of Ply. Col. from 1621 to 1657,
  (the year he died) aged 69, except 5 yrs. which he declined.

The grave of that sturdy old Pilgrim, John Howland, has a great
attraction for thousands who tread this sacred soil, many of whom
come from the good old Pilgrim stock. The stone is of reddish hue,
tall and wide, and bears the following beautiful inscription:—

  Here ended the Pilgrimage of
  J O H N  H O W L A N D
  who died February 23, 167⅔
  aged above 80 years.
  He married Elizabeth daughter of
  J O H N  T I L L E Y
  who came with him in the
  Mayflower Dec. 1620.
  From them are descended a
  numerous posterity.

       *       *       *       *       *

  “Hee was a godly man and an ancient professor in the wayes of
  Christ. Hee was one of the first comers into this land and was the
  last man that was left of those that came over in the Shipp called
  the Mayflower that lived in Plymouth.”

  _Plymouth Records._

One of the six stones bearing date in the seventeenth century marks
the grave of Thomas Clark, or Clarke, who is often spoken of as
the “mate of the ‘Mayflower.’” History, however, tells a different
story, and it is known that the name of the first officer of the
ship was John Clark. The stone is of purple Welsh slate, and is thus
lettered:—

  Here lyes ye body of Mr. Thomas Clark aged 98 years departed this
  life March ye 24th 1697.

A huge boulder has been recently placed on this grave, and a metallic
plate secured to it reads:—

  Here lies buried ye body of Mr. Thomas Clarke, aged 98. Departed
  this life March 24, 1697. Thomas Clarke came to Plymouth from
  England in the ship Anne 1623. He married Susan Ring of Plymouth,
  1634. Their children were Andrew, James, William, Susanna,
  Nathaniel, and John. From whom descended a numerous posterity. He
  married his second wife, Mrs. Alice Hallett Nichols of Boston,
  in 1664. He lived for some years in Boston, and also in Harwich,
  of which town he was one of the original proprietors. He died in
  Plymouth, having lived in the reigns of six British sovereigns and
  the Com’th. This stone is erected to his memory by his descendants
  A.D. 1891.

[Illustration: Thomas Clark tombstone]

It is with reverent step that the latter-day Pilgrim approaches the
Cushman monument, an enduring memorial to a “precious servant of
God.” This is a granite column, twenty-five feet high, and it is
by far the most conspicuous monument on the hill. There is a bronze
tablet on each of its four sides, that on the northerly side reading
as follows:—

[Illustration: Cushman Monument.]

  R O B E R T  C U S H M A N,

  Fellow-exile with the Pilgrims in Holland,
  Afterwards their chief agent in England,
  Arrived here -IX- November, -MDCXXI,
  With Thomas Cushman his son:
  Preached -IX- December,
  His memorable sermon on “The Danger of self-love
  And the sweetness of true friendship:”
  Returned to England -XIII- December,
  To vindicate the enterprise of Christian emigration;
  And there remained in the service of the Colony Till -MDCXXV,
  When, having prepared to make Plymouth His permanent home.

West side:—

  He died, lamented by the forefathers
  as “their ancient friend,—who was
  as their right hand with their friends
  the adventurers, and for divers years
  had done and agitated all their business
  with them to their great advantage.”

  “And you, my loving friends, the adventurers
  to this plantation, as your care has been first
  to settle religion here before either profit
  or popularity, so, I pray you, go on.——
  I rejoice——that you thus honor God
  with your riches, and I trust you shall be repaid
  again double and treble in this world, yea,
  and the memory of this action shall never die.”

  DEDICATION OF THE SERMON.

[Illustration: Thomas Cushman tombstone]

The stone originally erected over the grave of Elder Thomas Cushman
was removed in 1858 to make room for this memorial, and now stands a
little distance from its first position. It is of purple Welsh slate,
and is in a remarkable state of preservation. The inscription is as
follows:—

  Here lyeth buried ye body of that precious servant of God, Mr.
  T H O M A S  C U S H M A N, who after he had served his generation
  according to the will of God, and particularly the church of
  Plymouth for many years in the office of a ruleing elder fell
  asleep in Jesus Decmr. ye 10, 1691 & ye 84. year of his age.

[Illustration: Francis Le Barran tombstone]

There is always eager inquiry from the visitors to Burial Hill for
the grave of the “Nameless Nobleman,” the hero of Mrs. Jane G.
Austin’s famous historical novel of that title. We find it near the
Cushman monument. The stone has the small figure of an hourglass at
its top, under which appears the winged cherub, the sculpture being
better defined than is usual in such old work. The inscription reads:—

  Here lyes ye body of Mr. FRANCIS LE BARRAN phytician who departed
  this life Augst ye 18th 1704, in ye 36 year of his age.

Dr. Le Baron was the surgeon of a French ship which was wrecked
in Buzzard’s Bay in 1694. With the officers and crew he was taken
prisoner and sent to Boston. On their way a stop was made at
Plymouth, where the doctor had occasion to perform a surgical
operation. This led to a request, made by the citizens to the
lieutenant-governor, and granted, that he be allowed to remain in the
town. From him the numerous Le Barons in America are descended.

[Illustration: Nathaniel Goodwin tombstone]

By the side of Dr. Le Baron is buried his wife Mary, who after his
death married a Wait. Near by is the grave of their son, Dr. Lazarus
Le Baron, who also figures in Mrs. Austin’s writings; and in the
rear of these graves is seen the tombstone of Nathaniel Goodwin, the
great-grandfather of Mrs. Jane (Goodwin) Austin, who married Lydia,
daughter of Lazarus Le Baron.

Various other people mentioned in Mrs. Austin’s novels are buried in
this ground. Among them is Ansel Ring, who, as we are told in “Dr. Le
Baron and His Daughters,” was cursed by the old witch, Mother Crewe.
He lies with the sixty seamen who perished on board the “General
Arnold.” A marble shaft on the extreme southwesterly edge of the
hill marks the place of their interment. The inscription on the
northeasterly side is:—

  In memory of Seventy two Seamen who perished in Plymouth harbour
  on the 26, and 27, days of December 1778, on board the private
  armed Brig, Gen. Arnold, of twenty guns, James Magee of Boston,
  Commander, sixty of whom were buried on this spot.

On the northwesterly side:—

  Capt. James Magee died in Roxbury, February 4, 1801; aged 51 years.

On the southwesterly side:—

  Oh! falsely flattering were yon billows smooth
  When forth, elated, sailed in evil hour,
  That vessel whose disastrous fate, when told,
  Fill’d every breast with sorrow and each eye
  With piteous tears.

On the southeasterly side:—

  This monument marks the resting place of sixty of the seventy two
  mariners, “who perished in their strife with the storm,” and is
  erected by Stephen Gale of Portland, Maine, a stranger to them, as
  a just memorial of their sufferings and death.

[Illustration: Hannah Howland tombstone]

Another of Mrs. Austin’s characters is Hannah Howland, who is said to
have died of a broken heart on account of Ring’s sad end. Her stone
is to be found on the crown of the hill, not far from the Le Baron
graves. Its inscription reads:—

  _Sic Transit Gloria Mundi_
  To the memory of Miss Hannah Howland, who died of a
  Languishment, January ye 25th 1780 Ætatis 26.

  For us they languish, & for us they die
  And shall they languish shall they die in vain.

Readers of “Dr. Le Baron and His Daughters” will recall the following
reference to the graves of the Howland family:—

  Consider Howland slept with his fathers on Burying Hill, and Ruth
  Bryant, his loving wife, had meekly followed him thither. You may
  see their stones today, in the shadow of that majestic though
  mistaken monument to the memory of John Howland, the Pilgrim, who
  married Elizabeth Tilley, and not Ellzabeth, daughter of childless
  Governor Carver. There too may you see a plaintive little stone to
  the memory of

  Consider son to Mr Consider
  and Mrs. Ruth Howland,
  Aged 7 years.

The graves of Capt. Abraham Hammatt and Capt. Simeon Sampson, both
mentioned in “Dr. Le Baron and His Daughters,” are to be seen here.

Capt. Sampson’s tombstone is referred to among those of the
Revolutionary patriots. That of Capt. Hammatt is near the group of
Howland graves, and is thus inscribed:—

  In This sacred spot Are deposited the remains of Capt Abraham
  Hammatt who died of a malignant Fever October 12th 1797 _Ætatis_ 47
  And of his daughter Sophia who On the fst December following Fell a
  victim to the same Disease _Ætatis_ 13.

  Hers was the mildness of the rising Morn
  And his the radiance of the risen day.

The stone of Elder Faunce occupies a prominent position on the
hilltop. It bears the figure of a skeleton, seated on an hourglass.
The left hand of the skeleton holds a scythe, and wings are attached
to the hourglass. Above the figure is the drawing of a scallop shell.
The inscription is:—

  Here lyes buried the Body of Mr. THOMAS FAUNCE ruling
  ELDER of the first Church of CHRIST in _Plymouth_
  deceased Febry 27th An: Dom. 1745-6 in the 99th year of his Age.

  The Fathers, where are they?
  Blessed are the dead who
  Die in the Lord.


Near by are entombed the remains of Dr. Chandler Robbins, and on the
stone we read:—

  This Stone Consecrated to the memory Of the Revd Chandler Robbins D
  D was erected By the inhabitants of the first Religious Society in
  Plymouth As their last grateful tribute of respect For his eminent
  labors In the ministry of J E S U S  C H R I S T Which commenced
  January 30th 1760 And continued till his death June 30th 1799
  Ætatis 61 When he entered into the everlasting rest Prepared for
  the faithful ambassadors Of the most high God.

  Ah come heaven’s radiant Offspring hither throng
  Behold your prophet your Elijah fled
  Let sacred symphony attune each tongue
  To chant hosannahs with the virtuous dead.

[Illustration: James Kendall tombstone]

A few feet away is the white marble slab erected to the memory of
another noted divine, Dr. James Kendall, of blessed memory, who for
more than half a century served the First Church as its pastor. It is
thus inscribed:—

  Rev. James Kendall, D.D. Ordained 1 Jan. 1800. Died 17 March 1859.
  Aged 89 years. For sixty years Minister of the First Parish in this
  town.

Plymouth played her part in the Revolution, and of her soldiers and
sailors who fought in that memorable struggle a number are buried in
this historic ground.

Near the site of the old fort an iron fence encloses the Warren lot.
Within it stands the monument of Gen. James Warren, president of the
Provincial Congress and major-general of the militia. He died in
1808. His wife, Mercy Warren, sister of James Otis, the patriot, lies
in the same enclosure. She was a woman of marked literary ability,
and the author of several works. Their son James, who served with
Paul Jones on the “Bon Homme Richard,” and who lost a limb in one of
the naval engagements, is said to have been buried in this lot, but
there is no stone to indicate the grave. It is quite probable that
the body was laid away in the Warren tomb, at the foot of the hill.

[Illustration: Simeon Sampson tombstone]

Capt. Simeon Sampson was another Revolutionary hero of renown. His
stone is to be seen on the northerly side of the hill, near the path
leading from School to Russell Streets. In 1762 he was taken prisoner
by the French and held for ransom, but escaped from his captors by
assuming female attire. At the outbreak of the Revolution, when a
marine force was deemed necessary to protect our commerce from
depredation by British cruisers, he was the first naval captain in
the continental service to be appointed by the Provincial Congress
of Massachusetts. He died in 1789 at the age of fifty-three, and his
epitaph tells us:—

  O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains
  Draw near with pious reverence and attend
  Here lie the loving Husbands dear remains
  The tender Father and the courteous Friend
  The dauntless heart yet touched by human woe
  A Friend to man to vice alone a Foe.

Not far away is the stone of Gen. Nathaniel Goodwin, a well-known
military character of the last century. His house was where the
Baptist church now stands. He had charge of the enlistments for the
Revolutionary army in this quarter of the State. On the surrender of
Burgoyne and his men, Gen. Goodwin was placed in command of the guard
over them at Somerville. Burgoyne’s sword fell into his possession.
He died in 1819.

Just across the path from the grave of William Crowe is the tombstone
of Capt. Jacob Taylor, another of Plymouth’s Revolutionary patriots,
who died in 1788. Beneath the name and date we read these quaintly
worded lines:—

  Through life he brav’d her foe if great or small
  And march’d out forem_u_st at his country’s call.

On the southeasterly hillside we catch sight of the name of Capt.
Nathaniel Carver, beneath the weeping-willow and urn, the common
mortuary emblems of those days. Capt. Carver commanded a vessel
which was captured by the famous Admiral Nelson. The Yankee captain
was enabled, however, to do the great naval officer a good turn by
piloting him out of a place of danger; and the following document,
in possession of Hon. William T. Davis, the historian of Plymouth,
explains itself:—

  These are to certify that I took the schooner Harmony. Nathaniel
  Carver, master, belonging to Plymouth, but on acc’t of his good
  services have given him up his vessel again. Dated on b’d His
  Majesty’s ship Albemarle, 7 Aug., 1782, in Boston Bay.

  HORATIO NELSON.


On the west side of the hill are the graves of Dr. William Thomas,
a surgeon in the expedition against Louisburg in 1745; and his sons
Joshua, who was on the staff of the Revolutionary Gen. Thomas;
Joseph, a captain of artillery in the Revolution; John, a surgeon’s
mate under his father; and Nathaniel, who was also engaged in the
struggle for independence.

Other soldiers of our first war who are buried here are Dr. James
Thatcher, a surgeon in the American army, and an early historian of
Plymouth; Col. Ben Warren, a brave officer, whose grave is unmarked:
and Capt. William Pearson, who, as his epitaph informs us, was “a
true patriot and a hero of the Revolution.” Col. Warren, by the
way, has some claim to distinction from having married four wives,
the last marriage taking place fifty-eight years after the first—a
circumstance which for a time puzzled the searchers of genealogical
records. Speaking of “men of war,” mention should be made of Caleb
Cook, whose place of interment is near the Le Baron graves. He was
with Capt. Church at the battle in which King Philip was killed.
There are known to be graves of at least twenty-two Revolutionary
patriots on the hill, and 193 who served in the late Rebellion are
buried here.

Many visitors to Burial Hill, particularly those of the Baptist
faith who hold in reverence the name of its great missionary, find
more than a passing interest in the white marble slab which stands
as a memorial to the Judson family. It is near the site of the
watch-tower, and is enclosed by white wooden palings. It bears the
following inscription:—

[Illustration: The Judson Family.]

  Sacred to the memory of Rev. ADONIRAM JUDSON, who died Nov. 28,
  1826, Æ. 75. A faithful and devoted Minister of Christ. ELNATHAN
  JUDSON, M. D. who died at Washington City May 8, 1829, Æ. 34 years.
  ANN H. JUDSON, his dau. died May 30, 1832, Æ. 7 years. ELLEN YOUNG,
  his wife, died Nov. 25, 1832, Æ. 30 y’rs. ANN H. JUDSON, Missionary
  to Burmah, who died at Amherst, B. E. Oct. 24, 1826, Æ. 37 y’rs.

  Missionary Union to the Burman Empire, who died at Sea, April 12,
  1850, Æ. 62 years. EMILY C. widow of Adoniram Judson, D. D. &
  Missionary to Burmah, died June 1, 1854, Æ. 37 y’rs. ABIGAIL BROWN
  JUDSON, born in Malden, March 21, 1791, died in Plymouth, Jan. 25,
  1884.

[Illustration: Caleb Cook tombstone]

[Illustration: Thomas Russell tombstone]

In the same enclosure is a stone inscribed as follows:—

  Sacred to the memory of MRS. ABIGAIL widow of the late Rev.
  Adoniram Judson who died Jan. 31, 1842, aged 82 years.

  Her hope was in the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
  She felt the balm and efficacy of those leaves which are for the
  healing of the nations.

  A guilty weak and helpless worm,
    On thy kind arms I fall
  Be thou my guide and righteousness
    My Jesus and my all.

A few steps along the path northward from the Judson lot, and we come
to a rough boulder on which is carved the name of Thomas Russell,
and the dates Sept. 26, 1825, and Feb. 9, 1887. Judge Russell was
for many years president of the Pilgrim Society and took an active
interest in the history of the old town. It is fitting that his
earthly remains should find a resting-place in this ground.

Under the shadow of the Bradford monument, not many feet away, is a
blue slate stone with this inscription:—

  Here lies the body of ye honorable Major William Bradford, who
  expired Feb. ye 20th 1703-4, aged 79 y’rs.

  He lived long but still was doing good
  & in his country’s service lost much blood;
  After a life well spent he’s now at rest,
  His very name and memory is blest.

The stone of Nathaniel Morton, which we see a little way beyond, is
chiefly interesting from its figure of a man rising from the tomb,
emblematic of the resurrection.

Let us take a turn on this part of the hill where we are now
standing, and note some of the quaint epitaphs. Beginning with
a low, moss-covered stone just across the path from the Russell
boulder, we find the following worthy of our attention:—

  To the memory of
  Mr John Rider who
  Dec March the 11
  1756 aged 47
  years Wanting
  4 days.

Near this is a stone which is sometimes called the “Masonic stone.”
It bears the name of Nathaniel Jackson, and the date 1743. Above
the lettering the sculptor has engraved a death’s-head, a tomb, an
hourglass, cross-bones, an urn, a rose-tree, and the figure of a
skeleton seated on a globe.

  Faithful Officer, sincere Friend
  and honest Man
  Coll Isaac Lothrop
  who resigned this Life
  on the 26th day of April 1750
  in the 43 year of his age.

  Had Virtues Charms the power to save
  Its faithful Votaries from the grave
  This stone would neer possess the fame
  Of being marked by Lothrop’s name.

Continuing our search along the southeasterly slope we find these
three. The first two quoted are near the tombs at the foot of the
hill:—

  In memory of John W. Howard Son of Capt. James Howard & Mrs. Hannah
  his wife born March 20, 1815 died April 2, 1815

  He glanc’d into the world to see
  A sample of our misery.

  In memory of Thomas Paty son of Mr Thomas Paty and Mrs Jorusha his
  wife who departed this life Oct 7th 1802 aged 2 years 10 months and
  20 days.

  And must thy childrin Dye so soon.


Passing around the southerly edge of the hill, we pause a moment to
read these words:—

  To the memory of Isaac Eames Cobb who was born Jany 19, 1789, and
  died Jany 14, 1821.

  Possess’d he talents ten, or five or one
  The work he had to do that work was done
  Improv’d his mind, in wisdom’s ways he trod
  Reluctant died, but died resigned to G O D.

For quaintness of diction this is well matched by the two following
headstones, which are close at hand:—

  To the memory of Thomas Bartlett son of Mr. Thomas & Mrs. Ruth
  Bartlett who died Septr 9th 1802 aged 1 year 2 months 11 days.

  That once loved form now cold & dead,
  Each mournfull thought imploys
  And nature weeps his comforts fled
  And withered all his joys,

  But ceas fond nature dry thy tears
  Religion pints on high
  And ever lasting spring appears
  And joys that never die.

  Here lyes buried ye body of Mr. Thomas Little Practitioner in
  Physick & Chyrurgery Aged 58 years Decd Decemr ye 22 1712

As we turn thence westerly we pass these inscriptions:—

  Erected to the memory of Mrs. MEHITABEL, wife of Capt. Thos.
  Atwood, who died Jan. 11, 1809, In the 58 year of her age. In
  early life her feeble constitution gave painful premonition of her
  early exit. She however unexpectedly passed the meridian of life,
  discharging in a very laudable manner, filial parental & conjugal
  duties. At length the seeds of death were planted in her vitals—she
  sickened, languished & expired in hopes of a blessed immortality.

  Short is our longest day of life,
  And soon its prospect ends
  Yet on that day’s uncertain date
  Eternity depends.


  A N D R E W  F A R R E L L, of respectable connexions In

  Sailed from Boston Jany 26, And was wrecked on Plymouth Beach Jany
  28 1805. His remains With five of seven seaman Who perished with him
  are here interred.

  O piteous lot of man’s uncertain state!
  What woes on life’s eventful journey wait—
  By sea what treacherous calms; what sudden storms;
  And death attendant in a thousand forms.

       *       *       *       *       *

  In memory of Mr Benjamin Harlow who died November 18th 1816 aged 34
  years.

  Friends and physicians could not save
  My mortal Body from the Grave
  Nor can the Grave confine me here
  When Christ the son of God appears

The westerly side of the hill abounds in curious inscriptions, and
among them we note the following:—

  Here lies Interrd
  The Body of Ms

  Sacred to the memory of Phebe J. Bramhall, A native of Virginia &

  Possess’d of an amiable disposition, She endeared herself to
  all around her
  “but”
  Weep not for her in her Spring time she flew
  To that land, where the wings of the soul are unfurl’d
  And now, like a star beyond evening’s cold dew
  Looks radiantly down on the tears of this world.

The three latter are on the extreme westerly edge of the ground, not
far from the corner where the powder house was built in 1770. No
trace of this structure remains.

Turning our steps toward the northerly side, the following epitaphs
invite our attention:—

  To the Memory Of Mrs. ANNA JACKSON Obii. July 20, 1794

There are about 2,150 headstones on Burial Hill, and many graves are
unmarked. In some cases, undoubtedly, this absence of a memorial is
due to the considerable cost of stones in the early days. In other
instances the monuments have fallen prey to the ravages of time.
Rigid restrictions now govern burials in this ground.

Standing thus among the graves of the pioneer dead and putting all
modern life behind him, one’s thoughts go back across the centuries
and grasp, with a new sense of reality, the facts of Pilgrim history.
The Forefathers, who did brave deeds and suffered much, and planted
in the wilderness the seeds of a free nation, stand forth not as
shadowy historical figures, but as living men. And thinking on such
things, these words of the poet Pierpont find ready echo:—

  “The Pilgrim spirit has not fled,
    It walks in noon’s broad light;
  And it watches the bed of the glorious dead,
    With the holy stars, by night.
  It watches the bed of the brave who have bled,
    And shall guard this ice-bound shore,
  Till the waves of the bay, where the Mayflower lay,
    Shall foam and freeze no more!”

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
