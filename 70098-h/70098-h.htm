<span style="margin-left: -2em;">No spot in Plymouth is so interesting to</span>
the antiquary as Burial Hill. Here are
the sites of the Pilgrims’ fort and watch-tower.
Here sleep the early settlers of
the colony, the heroes of the Revolution
and of our later wars, and the men who went
“down to the sea in ships” and braved dangers,
in the days of Plymouth’s maritime glory. Here
are to be seen the rude symbols of the sculptor’s art
and the crude effusions of the elegiac poet.</p>

<p>Burial Hill is 165 feet above the sea level, and
rises abruptly just back of the town’s busiest thoroughfare.
It is irregular in form and contains about
eight acres. From this elevation the visitor has a
splendid panorama of ocean and country. Nestling
at his feet, between the hill and the sea, are the
thickly clustering roofs of the old town. Turning
his eyes northward, he sees in the far distance the
villages of Kingston and Duxbury and the monument
on Captain’s Hill, erected in memory of Myles Standish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the doughty Pilgrim commander. To the west
stretches a rolling swell of hills, ending in an almost
unbroken forest, through whose shades Massasoit led
his warriors to meet the Plymouth colonists. On
the south, shrouded in purple mist, are the “Pine
Hills” of Manomet. Looking eastward, across the
bay he spies the green dot known as Clark’s Island,
where the Pilgrims spent their first Sabbath; and far
beyond the shining strand of Plymouth Beach, if the
day be clear and his vision keen, he can just discern
Provincetown, at the point of Cape Cod,—the “tip
end of Yankee-land.”</p>

<p>Visited as it is daily by tourists from all parts of
the world, it is fitting that this consecrated ground
should be well cared for and that its surroundings
should be somewhat in keeping with its historic
character. By the will of J. Henry Stickney of
Baltimore, late vice-president of the Pilgrim Society,
$10,000 was bequeathed for improvements on this
ground. It had been suggested that the legacy be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
used in removing some, at least, of the unsightly
buildings which skirt the foot of the hill on the
easterly side, and in the erection of an ornamental
gateway at the Town Square entrance.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i007" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80">CHURCH OF THE FIRST PARISH.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are several ways of approaching Burial Hill,
but the main entrance is at Town Square. As we
pass through the gateway the new First Church, now
in process of building (1896), looms up on our left.
It is of gray stone, in the Norman type of architecture,
and its severity of style is suggestive of the rugged
lives of the Fathers. In the vestibule of the square
central tower will be placed tablets of a historical
character. This church is the oldest religious organization
in the country. In an unbroken succession
the ministry of this church has continued from the
days of Robinson and Brewster to the present. Its
records are piously preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Aside from its interest to those who find pleasure
in meditation among the tombs of past generations,
Burial Hill has a history which forms a part of the
early history of the town. Long before the spot was
used for burial purposes, it served as a ground for
possible defence against the savage foe, and here the
first church of the colony was established. Shortly
after the landing of the Pilgrims, on Dec. 21, 1620,
they set about to provide against attack from the
redskins, and we learn from their records that “in
one field is a great hill, on which we poynt to make
a platform and plant our ordnance, which will command
all round about.”</p>

<p>In 1622 a larger fort was erected, and in 1627
De Raisieres describes it as a large square house,
with flat roof made of thick sawn planks, stayed with
oak beams, upon the top of which six cannon were
mounted. The lower part was used for a church.
The Pilgrims assembled at beat of drum, each with
his musket or firelock, and marched to the place of
worship.</p>

<p>The exact situation of this fort is unknown. No
traces of it remain. It is reasonable to suppose,
however, that it stood well toward the top of the
hill on the southeasterly side, on a spot which would
command the approach from Leyden Street (the first
thoroughfare) on the east and the approach from the
path leading to the fording-place on the south. This
path, now Spring Street, leads directly from the hill
to Town Brook.</p>

<p>On Sept. 23, 1643, it was agreed that a watchhouse
“shall be forthwith built of brick.” This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
structure stood at the top of the hill, on the southeasterly
side, and commanded a wide view of all
the country about. Its bounds are marked by four
square granite blocks, and a small oval stone on a
standard, suitably inscribed, more definitely designates
the location. Within recent years pieces of
the brick of which this watchhouse, or watch-tower,
as it is more commonly called, have been unearthed.</p>

<p>Strolling down the southeasterly slope, the visitor
comes to another similar oval stone, which tells us
that here stood the old fort, erected in 1621. This
may be the site of the first fortification, but history
makes no record of it. We have evidence, however,
that in 1676, when invasion from King Philip, the
Indian chieftain, was feared, a fort was built on this
spot, and the conformation of the ground indicates
the existence at some time of such a work. On
Feb. 19, 1676, the colonists decided to erect a fortification,
“to be a hundred foot square, the pallasadoes
to be ten foot and a halfe longe; to be sett two foot
and a halfe in the Ground; and to be sett against a
post and a Rail ... and that there shal be a watch
house erected within the said ffence or fortification,
and that the three peece of ordnance shal be planted
within the said ffence or fortification ... said
watch house which is to be sixteen foot in length
and twelve foot in breadth and eight foot stud, to
be walled with board.”</p>

<p>This construction is significant of the peril of the
times and of the stern and unbending determination
of the Forefathers. With the close of King Philip’s
War the fort was abandoned, and in 1677 the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of which it was built was granted to one William
Harlow. Some of the massive timbers were used in
the construction of the old Harlow house on Sandwich
Street, and are still to be seen.</p>

</figure>


<p>The hill was not used as a place of burial until
after it was abandoned for defensive purposes. Those
of the “Mayflower” company who died the first winter
were buried on Cole’s Hill, and, while no traces of
their graves remain, a tablet appropriately inscribed
marks their resting-place. Others of the Pilgrim
band found burial on their own estates, and no man
knoweth their sepulchre. The first mention of Burial
Hill as a cemetery was in 1698, when Chief Justice
Sewall recorded the following in his diary: “I walk
out in the morn to see the mill, then turn up to the
graves, come down to the meeting-house, and seeing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>the door partly open went in and found a very convenient
place to pray.”</p>

<p>The oldest stone in this ground is that of Edward
Gray, and bears the date of 1681. It is probable,
however, that earlier burials took place here.
Tradition says that the oldest grave is that of John
Howland, who died in 1672, although the stone
which marks it was erected within comparatively
recent years. Tradition also places here the earthly
remains of Gov. William Bradford, and a monument
bearing his name rises among the graves of
the Bradford family, the exact place of the Governor’s
interment, however, not being designated.</p>

<p>There are six ancient gravestones bearing date
before 1700, as follows:—</p>

<p class="lh">Edward Gray, 1681.</p>
<p class="lh">William Crowe, 1683-84.</p>
<p class="lh">Hannah Clark, 1687.</p>
<p class="lh">Thomas Cushman, 1691.</p>
<p class="lh">Thomas Clark, 1697.</p>
<p class="lh">Ten children of John and Josiah Cotton, 1699.</p>

<p>Possibly there is a seventh,—the defaced tombstone
of Nathaniel Thomas, who is said to have
died in 1697. The figures on the stone are illegible.</p>

<p>All these stones are on the summit of the hill,
within a narrow radius, and near the intersection of
the two main paths. With the exception of Gray’s,
all are of English make, and in fact most of those
bearing dates to 1745 were brought from across the
water.</p>

<p>The Gray stone, the oldest on the hill, as has been
said, is of dark, compact slate. It probably has the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>usual “cherub,” or symbol; if so, it is concealed by
the iron hood which protects the edges from water
and frost. By its side is a wooden slab bearing the
legend, “The Grave of Edward Gray, June, 1681.”
The inscription on the stone is as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Edward Gray appeared in Plymouth about the year
1643. Tradition has it that he and his brother were
sent from England in order that scheming relations
might obtain possession of their property. He became
a merchant, and the wealthiest man in the
colony.</p>

<p>The Bradford obelisk is one of the first objects to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>

on a granite base, and rises to a height of eight feet

<p>The grave of that sturdy old Pilgrim, John Howland,
has a great attraction for thousands who tread

<p>One of the six stones bearing date in the seventeenth
century marks the grave of Thomas Clark, or
Clarke, who is often spoken of as the “mate of the
‘Mayflower.’” History, however, tells a different story,
and it is known that the name of the first officer of the
ship was John Clark. The stone is of purple Welsh
slate, and is thus lettered:—</p>

Departed this life March 24, 1697. Thomas Clarke came to
Plymouth from England in the ship Anne 1623. He married
Susan Ring of Plymouth, 1634. Their children were Andrew,
James, William, Susanna, Nathaniel, and John. From whom
descended a numerous posterity. He married his second wife,
Mrs. Alice Hallett Nichols of Boston, in 1664. He lived for
some years in Boston, and also in Harwich, of which town he was
one of the original proprietors. He died in Plymouth, having
lived in the reigns of six British sovereigns and the Com’th.
This stone is erected to his memory by his descendants A.D. 1891.</p>

the officers and crew he was taken prisoner and sent
to Boston. On their way a stop was made at Plymouth,
where the doctor had occasion to perform a
surgical operation. This led to a request, made by
the citizens to the lieutenant-governor, and granted,
that he be allowed to remain in the town. From him
the numerous Le Barons in America are descended.</p>

Goodwin, the great-grandfather of Mrs. Jane
(Goodwin) Austin, who married Lydia, daughter of
Lazarus Le Baron.</p>

<p>Various other people mentioned in Mrs. Austin’s
novels are buried in this ground. Among them is
Ansel Ring, who, as we are told in “Dr. Le Baron
and His Daughters,” was cursed by the old witch,
Mother Crewe. He lies with the sixty seamen who
perished on board the “General Arnold.” A marble
shaft on the extreme southwesterly edge of the hill
marks the place of their interment. The inscription
on the northeasterly side is:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80">In memory of Seventy two Seamen who perished in Plymouth
harbour on the 26, and 27, days of December 1778, on

buried on this spot.</p>

<p>Another of Mrs. Austin’s characters is Hannah
Howland, who is said to have died of a broken heart
on account of Ring’s sad end. Her stone is to be
found on the crown of the hill, not far from the Le
Baron graves. Its inscription reads:—</p>

<p class="center fs80 no-indent">

<p>The graves of Capt. Abraham Hammatt and Capt.
Simeon Sampson, both mentioned in “Dr. Le Baron
and His Daughters,” are to be seen here.</p>

<p>Capt. Sampson’s tombstone is referred to among
those of the Revolutionary patriots. That of Capt.
Hammatt is near the group of Howland graves, and
is thus inscribed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The stone of Elder Faunce occupies a prominent
position on the hilltop. It bears the figure of a
skeleton, seated on an hourglass. The left hand
of the skeleton holds a scythe, and wings are attached
to the hourglass. Above the figure is the drawing

<p>A few feet away is the white marble slab erected
to the memory of another noted divine, Dr. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Kendall, of blessed memory, who for more than half
a century served the First Church as its pastor. It
is thus inscribed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80">Rev. James Kendall, D.D. Ordained 1 Jan. 1800. Died
17 March 1859. Aged 89 years. For sixty years Minister of
the First Parish in this town.</p>
</div>

<p>Plymouth played her part in the Revolution, and
of her soldiers and sailors who fought in that memorable
struggle a number are buried in this historic
ground.</p>

<p>Near the site of the old fort an iron fence encloses
the Warren lot. Within it stands the monument of
Gen. James Warren, president of the Provincial Congress
and major-general of the militia. He died in
1808. His wife, Mercy Warren, sister of James Otis,
the patriot, lies in the same enclosure. She was a
woman of marked literary ability, and the author of
several works. Their son James, who served with
Paul Jones on the “Bon Homme Richard,” and who
lost a limb in one of the naval engagements, is said
to have been buried in this lot, but there is no stone
to indicate the grave. It is quite probable that the
body was laid away in the Warren tomb, at the foot
of the hill.</p>

<p>Capt. Simeon Sampson was another Revolutionary
hero of renown. His stone is to be seen on the
northerly side of the hill, near the path leading from
School to Russell Streets. In 1762 he was taken
prisoner by the French and held for ransom, but
escaped from his captors by assuming female attire.
At the outbreak of the Revolution, when a marine
force was deemed necessary to protect our commerce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
from depredation by British cruisers, he was the first
naval captain in the continental service to be appointed
by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts.
He died in 1789 at the age of fifty-three, and his
epitaph tells us:—</p>

</div>


<p>Not far away is the stone of Gen. Nathaniel Goodwin,
a well-known military character of the last century.
His house was where the Baptist church now
stands. He had charge of the enlistments for the
Revolutionary army in this quarter of the State. On
the surrender of Burgoyne and his men, Gen. Goodwin
was placed in command of the guard over them
at Somerville. Burgoyne’s sword fell into his possession.
He died in 1819.</p>

<p>Just across the path from the grave of William
Crowe is the tombstone of Capt. Jacob Taylor, another
of Plymouth’s Revolutionary patriots, who died
in 1788. Beneath the name and date we read these
quaintly worded lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs80">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Through life he brav’d her foe if great or small</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>On the southeasterly hillside we catch sight of the
name of Capt. Nathaniel Carver, beneath the weeping-willow
and urn, the common mortuary emblems
of those days. Capt. Carver commanded a vessel
which was captured by the famous Admiral Nelson.
The Yankee captain was enabled, however, to do the
great naval officer a good turn by piloting him out
of a place of danger; and the following document,
in possession of Hon. William T. Davis, the historian
of Plymouth, explains itself:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80">These are to certify that I took the schooner Harmony.

Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>On the west side of the hill are the graves of Dr.
William Thomas, a surgeon in the expedition against
Louisburg in 1745; and his sons Joshua, who was on
the staff of the Revolutionary Gen. Thomas; Joseph,
a captain of artillery in the Revolution; John, a surgeon’s
mate under his father; and Nathaniel, who was
also engaged in the struggle for independence.</p>

<p>Other soldiers of our first war who are buried here
are Dr. James Thatcher, a surgeon in the American
army, and an early historian of Plymouth; Col. Ben
Warren, a brave officer, whose grave is unmarked:
and Capt. William Pearson, who, as his epitaph informs
us, was “a true patriot and a hero of the Revolution.”
Col. Warren, by the way, has some claim
to distinction from having married four wives, the
last marriage taking place fifty-eight years after the
first—a circumstance which for a time puzzled the
searchers of genealogical records. Speaking of “men
of war,” mention should be made of Caleb Cook,
whose place of interment is near the Le Baron graves.
He was with Capt. Church at the battle in which
King Philip was killed. There are known to be graves
of at least twenty-two Revolutionary patriots on the
hill, and 193 who served in the late Rebellion are
buried here.</p>

<p>Many visitors to Burial Hill, particularly those
of the Baptist faith who hold in reverence the name
of its great missionary, find more than a passing
interest in the white marble slab which stands as a
memorial to the Judson family. It is near the site
of the watch-tower, and is enclosed by white wooden
palings. It bears the following inscription:—</p>

<p>A few steps along the path northward from the
Judson lot, and we come to a rough boulder on which
is carved the name of Thomas Russell, and the dates
Sept. 26, 1825, and Feb. 9, 1887. Judge Russell was
for many years president of the Pilgrim Society and
took an active interest in the history of the old town.
It is fitting that his earthly remains should find a
resting-place in this ground.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of the Bradford monument, not
many feet away, is a blue slate stone with this inscription:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are about 2,150 headstones on Burial Hill,
and many graves are unmarked. In some cases,
undoubtedly, this absence of a memorial is due to
the considerable cost of stones in the early days.
In other instances the monuments have fallen prey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
to the ravages of time. Rigid restrictions now govern
burials in this ground.</p>

and planted in the wilderness the seeds of a free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
